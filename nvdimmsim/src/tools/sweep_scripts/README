This directory contains a set of scripts that were used for performing channel sweeps 
with perfect prefetching using trace-based sim mode. These can be adapted for any experiment
and is just here to provide an example of working scripts to run large series of experiments. 
The ini directory is included to show how to copy data into the hybridsim repo.
