FlashDIMMSim: a reasonably accurate flash DIMM simulator.

Acknowledgements:
	General design (anything not flash specific) borrows heavily from DRAMSim Copyright (C) 2008-2009 Elliot Cooper-Balis and Paul Rosenfeld (overall structure is very similar and some code snippets and classes are copy+paste).

Getting started:
	To run TraceBasedSim.cpp (doesn't actually run traces yet):

		cd src
		make
		./FDSim

	To create a shared library:

		cd src
		make libfdsim.so

Questions?
	Contact me at <slunk at umd dot edu>
